## What is SharkTrack?

To protect sharks and rays, scientists and conservationists monitor their populations with underwater videos (i.e. BRUVS, RUVS, ROVs).  This process requires them to manually analyse 1000s of hours of videos, which is extremely time-consuming.

SharkTrack is an AI-enhanced video annotation pipeline that uses computer vision to detect and track sharks/rays in BRUVS videos and computes ecology metrics (MaxN), used by ecologists.

We tested the performance of SharkTrack in [Varini et al 2024](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2407.20623) and found out that:

## How Does It Work?

SharkTrack analyses BRUVS in two steps:

![The SharkTrack pipeline](../../../assets/sharktrack/sharktrack-pipeline-figure.png)

### Step 1: Automatic Processing

- **(a)** Ingests all underwater videos in a hard drive or folder
- **(b)** Automatically detects and tracks elasmobranchs
- **(c)** Saves sightings in a CSV
- **(d)** Saves a screenshot for each detected elasmobranch


### Step 2: Manual Review
Scroll through the screenshot (detected individuals) and:
- **(e)** Delete false detections (i.e. algae, trash)
- **(f)** Classify the species of detected elasmobranchs by renaming the screenshot filename
- **(g)** With a script, SharkTrack updates all sightings with the new species classifications and outputs the species-specific MaxN

### Two Modes

- **🔎 Analyst Mode** — Detect and track sharks in the videos. Use it to derive relative abundance with MaxN metrics.
- **👀 Peek Mode** — Just detect sharks in videos. Use it for faster analysis but without tracking or MaxN computations downstream.

Both modes run on a standard laptop and do not require WiFi.
