## Overview

Shark and Ray (Elasmobranch) researchers monitor their populations using Baited Remote Underwater Video Systems (BRUVS). This is a time-consuming process, as each video needs to be manually annotated.

SharkTrack is a Machine Learning model that uses computer vision to detect and track Elasmobranchii in BRUVS videos and compute the MaxN metrics, used by ecologists.

> SharkTrack is an AI-enhanced workflow to convert raw BRUVS videos to MaxN, which has been tested **21x faster** than traditional methods.

## How Does It Work?

SharkTrack analyses BRUVS in two steps:

{/* TODO: Uncomment and adjust path once you have the pipeline figure image */}
{/* ![The SharkTrack pipeline](../../../assets/figure1.png) */}

### Step 1: Automatic Processing

- **(a)** Ingests all underwater videos in a hard drive or folder
- **(b)** Automatically detects elasmobranchs
- **(c)** Saves sightings in a CSV
- **(d)** Saves a screenshot for each detected elasmobranch

{/* TODO: Uncomment and adjust path once you have the detection example image */}
{/* ![Detection example](../../../assets/example_detection.jpg) */}

### Step 2: Manual Review

- **(e)** Classify the species of detected elasmobranchs by renaming the screenshot filename
- **(f)** SharkTrack updates all sightings with the new species classification
- **(g)** Outputs the species-specific MaxN

### Two Modes

- **👀 Peek Mode** — Run it overnight after a day of sampling. Automatically detect where and when sharks and rays appeared.
- **🔎 Analyst Mode** — Accurately analyse footage to derive relative abundance with MaxN metrics.

Both modes run on a standard laptop and do not require WiFi.
