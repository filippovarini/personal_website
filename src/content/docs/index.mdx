      07/07/2025: Deployed SeaSwipe, an AI Platform which ingests videos
      collected thousands of meters deep in real time and in real time it
      detects vulnerable organisms. The AI Model is included in a mobile
      application that expedition members can use to provide feedback to the
      model, which retrains in real time and improves its accuracy throughout
      the expedition.
