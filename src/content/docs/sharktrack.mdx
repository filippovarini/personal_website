SharkTrack is a software that detects sharks and rays in underwater videos and computes MaxN in 21x faster, with machine learning.

## Overview
Shark and Ray (Elasmobranch) researchers monitor their populations using Baited Remote Underwater Video Systems (BRUVS). This is a time-consuming process, as each video needs to be manually annotated. 

SharkTrack is a Machine Learning model that uses computer vision to detect and track Elasmobranchii in BRUVS videos and compute the MaxN metrics, used by ecologists.

*Therefore SharkTrack is an AI-enhanced workflow to convert raw BRUVS videos to MaxN, which has been tested 21x faster than traditional methods.*

## How is it useful
- 🏃‍♀️ Computes MaxN semi-automatically, 21x faster
- 🏝 Can detect any elasmobranch species (as a single 'elasmobranch' class) in any location with 89% accuracy
- 👨‍💻 Can run on a standard laptop - no experience or advanced tech requirement


## How does SharkTrack work?
SharkTrack analyses BRUVS in two steps, as showed in Fig. 3:
##### Step 1: Automatic Processing
- (a) Ingests all underwater videos in a hard drive or folder
- (b) Automatically detects elasmobranchs 
- (c) Save sightings in a CSV
- (d) Save a screenshot for each detected elasmobranch with video

*Figure 2: Each detection image shows the video and time it was captured* 

##### Step 2: Manual Review
- (e) Classify the species of detected elasmobranchs by renaming the relative screenshot filename.
- (f) SharkTrack updates all sightings of detected elasmobranchs with the new species classification
- (g) And outputs the species-specific MaxN

## How it can help you?
- 👀 **Peek Mode** After a day of sampling, run it on your laptop overnight and automatically detect where and when sharks and rays appeared in the videos.
- 🔎 **Analyst Mode** Accurately analyse the footage to derive relative abundance with the MaxN metrics.

Both modes can be run on a standard laptop and do not require WIFI.

Overall, SharkTrack is the most helpful to process videos where elasmobranch appears rarely, as it extracts them from the mainly empty footage, removeing the need to watch it manually.


## How can I run SharkTrack?
SharkTrack is a publicly-available model and you can install and run it by following [this guide](https://github.com/filippovarini/sharktrack/blob/master/sharktrack-user-guide.md).

If you don't have experience with Python, we know it can be daunting but don't fear! By following the guide step-by-step you will have SharkTrack up and running on your videos in less than 10 minutes.
